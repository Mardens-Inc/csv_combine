# CSV Combine v0.1.0 - Initial Release 🎉

A smart CSV and Excel file combiner that intelligently groups files by header compatibility and merges them with automatic column alignment.

## ✨ Highlights

- 🧠 **Smart Grouping** - Automatically detects compatible files using 50% column overlap threshold
- 📊 **Multi-Format** - Supports CSV, Excel (xlsx/xls/xlsm/xlsb), and ODS files
- 🔄 **Intelligent Merging** - Handles extra columns, missing columns, and reordered columns seamlessly
- 🏷️ **Smart Naming** - Output files named using header signatures for consistency
- ✅ **Well Tested** - 26 comprehensive tests with 100% pass rate

## 🚀 Quick Start

```bash
# Download the binary for your platform below

# Process files in current directory
./csv_combine

# Process files in a specific directory
./csv_combine /path/to/data

# Process a single file
./csv_combine /path/to/file.csv
```

## 💡 How It Works

### Compatible Files (≥50% overlap) → Merged
```
employees_jan.csv:  Name, Age, Department
employees_feb.csv:  Name, Age, Department, Location

Output: combined_abc123.csv
  All 4 columns with automatic alignment
```

### Incompatible Files (<50% overlap) → Separated
```
customers.csv: Name, Email, Phone
products.csv:  Product, Price, SKU

Output:
  single_aaa111.csv (customer data)
  single_bbb222.csv (product data)
```
